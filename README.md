# challenge-10-team-profile-generator

## Summary
This repository contains the Javascript code for the Team Profile Generator application. This application utilizes Node.js to create an HTML file displaying a team roster. To create the HTML file, the application uses the Inquirer Node Package to prompt the user with various questions related to different team roles (Manager, Engineer, and Intern) and utilizes this information to populate the the team and its members in an HTML file template. The application then uses the File System Node Module to write and save the file to the local system.
